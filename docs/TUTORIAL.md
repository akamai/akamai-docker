# Akamai Docker Development Environment Tutorial

This document provides examples of using the different packages and more explanations for those not so familiar with Docker.

## Starting Docker Containers for interactive use

Using [`docker run`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/) you can start an isolated docker container out of a docker image. There are several ways to use docker containers, for example:

### Permanent container (keep the session alive)

Start the container using `docker run`, then add `-it` to indicate interactive, followed by `--name` and a name of your choice to be able to refer to that container later on easily.

The example below creates a docker container named `akadev` out of the docker image `shell` within the organization `akamai`:

```bash
docker run -it --name akadev akamai/shell
```

You can then exit the container, and start it later on using:

```bash
docker start -i akadev
```

The files inside this docker container will persist in the host machine until the container is destroyed using `docker rm`. Once you remove the container using `docker rm` all the files inside will be lost.

### Permanent container (fresh session each time)

Sometimes you want to start a container fresh each time, without any leftover files from previous sessions. To do that, start the container using `docker run`, then add `-it` to indicate interactive, followed by `--rm` to indicate the container should be removed upon exit.

When using fresh containers, mount one or more files (or folders) from the host system into the container, for example, to provide access to the `.edgerc` file containing the Akamai OPEN API client credentials.

The example below creates a docker container out of the docker image `shell` within the organization `akamai`, that will be cleaned up `--rm` and mounts the `$HOME/.edgerc` file from the host machine into `/root/.edgerc` in the container as read-only:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $HOME/.edgerc:/root/.edgerc:ro akamai/shell
```

> **Note:** In the above example we aren't giving the docker container a name using `--name`. In that case, docker will assign a random name that you can see running a `docker ps` command.

Another way to achieve the same result would be to, first, create a container using the command below:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $HOME/.edgerc:/root/.edgerc:ro akamai/shell
```

Then in another terminal window, run a `docker ps` to identify the docker container name (determined_borg in our example), and then copy the `$HOME/.edgerc` file into the container using `docker cp`:

```bash
docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES

docker cp $HOME/.edgerc determined_borg:/root/.edgerc
```
